There are two scripts in MATLAB that implement the DRRBF-PU (Direct Rational RBF Partition of Unity) method, for estimating the derivatives.

These scripts are

"D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m" and 

"D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m". 

To reproduce the results,

the user can directly run

"D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m" (see also the comments type proposed in the file).

   Note that:
   
a. To construct the local approximations in each patch a Mat√©rn radial kernel is utilized.

b. A compactly supported Wendland's function is used as the PU weights.

c. The user can change the radial kernel and PU weights (it also is possible to apply a discontinuous weight function).
