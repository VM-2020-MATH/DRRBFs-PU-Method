Two routines are written in MATLAB environment to implement the DRRBFs-PU technique. 

Two files are "D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m" and "D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m". 

To get the results, the user can directly run "D_Rational_RBFs_PU_2D.m" (see also the comments type proposed in the file).

   Note that:
   
a. To construct the local approximation in each patch. a Mat√©rn radial kernel is utilized.

b. A compactly supported Wendland's function is used as the PU weights.

c. The user can change the radial kernel and PU weights (it also is possible to apply a discontinuous weight function).
